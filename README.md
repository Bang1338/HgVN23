Footnotes
Here is a simple footnote[^1].
A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  
You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].
[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
	This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
	Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
	This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
